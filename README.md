# org-oci-distribution

[![CI](https://github.com/kotoba-lang/org-oci-distribution/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/kotoba-lang/org-oci-distribution/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

**An [OCI Distribution Spec](https://github.com/opencontainers/distribution-spec)
v1.1 server projected onto [kotobase](https://github.com/kotoba-lang/kotobase)**
— the same one-datom/document/block-plane pattern as
[`kotoba-lang/kotobase-protocols`](https://github.com/kotoba-lang/kotobase-protocols)
(s3/ipfs/atproto/git), scoped to its own repo per
[ADR-2607172210](https://github.com/com-junkawasaki/root/blob/main/90-docs/adr/2607172210-kotobase-protocol-layer-extension.edn)
in `com-junkawasaki/root`. Addressing contract: the Kotoba Resource
Protocol §16.2
(`90-docs/protocols/kotoba-resource-protocol.edn`,
[ADR-2607172200](https://github.com/com-junkawasaki/root/blob/main/90-docs/adr/2607172200-kotoba-resource-protocol-0.2-addendum.edn)).

## ORAS is NOT a second protocol — read this before adding one

**ORAS does not get its own implementation in this repo, and should
not get its own repo either.** ORAS's client is a convention over this
exact same OCI Distribution Spec v1.1 API — the same `/v2/...`
manifest/blob/referrers endpoints, used to distribute arbitrary
artifacts (Helm charts, SBOMs, WASM modules, arbitrary files) instead
of container images. There is no separate ORAS wire protocol to
implement: one server (this one) satisfies both OCI clients (`docker
pull`, `crane`, container runtimes) and ORAS clients (`oras push`/`oras
pull`) identically. This was confirmed and documented in
ADR-2607172210's Context and Rejected sections specifically so nobody
re-derives "maybe ORAS needs its own thing" from scratch later.

Every surface is a **pure cljc handler** over the injected
`kotobase.store/IStore` — the same seam that lets an app run standalone
on `kotobase.local/LocalStore` or against `kotobase.net`. No I/O, no
host JSON parser, no crypto library dependency (SHA-256 is computed via
`java.security.MessageDigest` on the JVM / `node:crypto` under
nbb/cljs — no third-party deps either way); deploy shells (Cloudflare
Worker, browser worker, fleet peer) own transport and bearer-token
authentication.

| Route | Method | Behavior |
|---|---|---|
| `/v2/` | GET | ping/version check — 200, empty body |
| `/v2/<name>/manifests/<reference>` | GET, HEAD | fetch manifest by tag or digest |
| `/v2/<name>/manifests/<reference>` | PUT | store manifest; digest computed + validated |
| `/v2/<name>/blobs/<digest>` | GET, HEAD | fetch blob by digest |
| `/v2/<name>/blobs/uploads/?digest=<d>` | POST | monolithic blob upload (full body, one request) |
| `/v2/<name>/tags/list` | GET | list tags (not digests) known for `<name>` |

`<name>` may contain `/` (e.g. `gftdcojp/kami-engine`), matching the
Docker/OCI repository-name convention.

```clojure
(require '[kotobase.local :as local]
         '[kotobase.protocols.oci :as oci])

(def ctx {:store (local/local-store) :apex "kotobase.net"})

(oci/handle ctx {:method :put :path "/v2/myorg/myapp/manifests/latest"
                 :headers {"authorization" "Bearer ..."
                           "content-type" "application/vnd.oci.image.manifest.v1+json"}
                 :body "{\"schemaVersion\":2}"})
;; => {:status 201 :headers {"docker-content-digest" "sha256:…" …} :body nil}

(oci/handle ctx {:method :get :path "/v2/myorg/myapp/manifests/latest"})
;; => {:status 200 … :body "{\"schemaVersion\":2}"}
```

## Scope guards (read before extending)

- **Chunked upload session flow is out of scope for v0.1.** Only
  monolithic upload (`POST .../blobs/uploads/?digest=<d>` with the
  full body in one request) is implemented — the multi-request
  `POST` (start session) → `PATCH` (chunks) → `PUT` (finalize) flow is
  a documented follow-up, mirroring `kotobase-protocols/s3.cljc`'s own
  explicit multipart-upload carve-out.
- **Bearer-token verification is deliberately NOT implemented.**
  `PUT` manifest and `POST` blob upload emit the real
  `WWW-Authenticate: Bearer realm="...",service="...",scope="..."`
  challenge shape when no `Authorization` header is present at all —
  but any non-empty header is accepted without checking a signature or
  claim. Real verification is the deploy shell's job, exactly as
  SigV4 verification lives outside `s3.cljc`, not inside it.
- **String bodies only (v0.1).** `kotobase.protocols.http`'s `:body`
  is an opaque string, matching `s3.cljc` exactly — this handler
  hashes and stores that string as-is. Real deployments will often
  push binary-shaped OCI layers; base64/binary-body handling is a
  follow-up in the shared `http.cljc` shape, not reinvented here.
- **Digests are real SHA-256, not the `hash.cljc` fingerprint
  convention.** KRP §16.2 is explicit that an OCI digest is Content
  identity (§3.3), a real CID-shaped hash — unlike the non-cryptographic
  FNV-1a fingerprints `kotobase-protocols/hash.cljc` uses for S3 ETags,
  which are explicitly documented as NOT CIDs. See
  `src/kotobase/protocols/oci/digest.cljk`.
- **No Referrers API** (`GET /v2/<name>/referrers/<digest>`) yet — not
  required for the v0.1 push/pull round trip; follow-up once a concrete
  ORAS/SBOM-discovery consumer needs it.
- **No manifest content validation.** Manifest JSON bytes are stored
  and digest-validated opaquely; `schemaVersion`/`mediaType`-specific
  referential integrity (e.g. that referenced config/layer blobs
  actually exist) and garbage collection of unreferenced blobs are not
  implemented.

## Develop / test

First-class runtime is **nbb/cljs** (repo-wide runtime priority):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kotoba-lang/kotobase .deps/kotobase
nbb --classpath "src:test:.deps/kotobase/src" bin/run_tests.cljk
```

The `:test` alias in `deps.edn` is the JVM **compat** suite only.
