;; `kotoba/oci/reference.kotoba` against the registry in
;; `kotobase.protocols.oci`.
;;
;; Every claim about the library is driven through its own `handle` and its
;; own `kotobase.local` store, so what is measured is what a client would
;; get.
;;
;; ## Findings
;;
;;   * `a-repository-name-is-never-checked` -- `handle` joins the path
;;     segments before the route tail and hands the result to the store as
;;     part of a key. `a/../b` pushes, `b` does not resolve it, and
;;     `a/../b` does; `MyApp` pushes and `myapp` does not resolve it. §4.1
;;     gives a lowercase-only grammar with no `.` or `..` component, and a
;;     store that maps keys to paths -- which is what `a/../b` is written
;;     for -- resolves out of its own key space.
;;
;;   * `a-tag-is-not-anything-without-a-colon` -- `digest-shaped?` decides
;;     whether a pushed reference is VERIFIED against the computed digest,
;;     so everything it calls a tag is stored unverified. Its notion of a
;;     tag is "no colon", and the §4.1 tag grammar is far narrower:
;;     `-bad..tag` is accepted and listed.
;;
;;   * `the-digest-shape-is-wider-than-the-digest-grammar` -- `SHA256:` and
;;     32 uppercase hex satisfies it, though the algorithm is lowercase in
;;     the spec and `sha256`'s encoding is exactly 64 lowercase hex.
;;
;;   * `segments-does-not-decode-what-its-docstring-says-it-decodes` --
;;     recorded, and NOT treated as a bug to fix in that direction:
;;     decoding would turn `%2F` into a separator the router never sees.
;;     The docstring is what is wrong.
