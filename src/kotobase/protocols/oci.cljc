(ns kotobase.protocols.oci
  "oci.kotobase.net — an OCI Distribution Spec v1.1 server projected onto
  the kotobase IStore document space (ADR-2607172210, KRP §16.2 /
  90-docs/adr/2607172200 — OCI tag → Name-like mutable pointer, OCI
  digest → Content identity, a real CID-shaped hash unlike ETags).

  ORAS NOTE (read this before building a second implementation): ORAS
  is NOT a separate wire protocol. ORAS's client is a convention over
  this exact same OCI Distribution Spec v1.1 API (manifests + blobs +
  the Referrers API) for distributing arbitrary artifacts instead of
  container images — same endpoints, same digest/tag identity, no
  separate mapping. This handler is the one server that satisfies both
  OCI and ORAS clients. Do not build a second 'oras' handler/repo;
  confirmed and documented in ADR-2607172210's Context/Rejected
  sections.

  Mapping:
    <name>          → may contain '/' (e.g. \"org/app\"); scopes both
                      collections below, matching the Docker/OCI
                      repository-name convention.
    manifests coll  → IStore collection [:kotobase.oci/manifests <name>],
                      keyed by *reference* (tag OR digest string).
                      A tag PUT is additionally indexed under its
                      computed digest, so a manifest pushed by tag is
                      always also retrievable by digest — matching real
                      registry behavior and the OCI conformance
                      expectation that every manifest has a canonical
                      digest address regardless of how it was pushed.
    blobs coll      → IStore collection [:kotobase.oci/blobs <name>],
                      keyed by digest only (blobs have no mutable name).
    tags/list       → derived, not stored: every manifests-coll key
                      that is NOT digest-shaped (kotobase.protocols.oci.digest/digest-shaped?).
    every write     → audit event on :kotobase.protocols/audit.

  Implemented subset (v0.1, per github.com/opencontainers/distribution-spec):
    GET  /v2/                                   ping/version check, 200 empty body
    GET  /v2/<name>/manifests/<reference>        fetch manifest by tag or digest
    HEAD /v2/<name>/manifests/<reference>        same, headers only
    PUT  /v2/<name>/manifests/<reference>        store manifest; digest computed + validated
    GET  /v2/<name>/blobs/<digest>                fetch blob by digest
    HEAD /v2/<name>/blobs/<digest>                same, headers only
    POST /v2/<name>/blobs/uploads/?digest=<d>     MONOLITHIC upload only (full body,
                                                   one request); digest validated
    GET  /v2/<name>/tags/list                     list known tags (not digests) for <name>

  Deliberately out of scope here:
  - **Chunked upload session flow** (POST to start a session + PATCH
    chunks + PUT to finalize). Only the monolithic single-POST-with-
    ?digest= upload is implemented. This mirrors s3.cljc's explicit
    multipart-upload carve-out — a real deploy shell that needs
    resumable/streamed pushes is a documented follow-up, not silently
    unsupported.
  - **Bearer-token verification.** `unauthorized` below emits the
    real WWW-Authenticate: Bearer realm=\"...\",service=\"...\",
    scope=\"...\" challenge shape on PUT manifest / POST blob upload
    when no `Authorization` header is present at all, but this
    namespace never validates a token's signature or claims — the
    deploy shell (Cloudflare Worker, browser worker, fleet peer) owns
    real bearer-token issuance/verification, exactly as SigV4
    verification is deferred by s3.cljc. Any non-empty Authorization
    header is currently accepted as \"the shell already checked this\".
  - **Binary blob bodies.** kotobase.protocols.http's :body is a
    string in v0.1 (its own documented follow-up); this handler hashes
    and stores that string as-is. Real deployments will often push
    binary-shaped OCI layers — base64/binary-body handling is a
    follow-up in http.cljc, not reinvented here.
  - **Referrers API** (`GET /v2/<name>/referrers/<digest>`) and content
    discovery extensions ORAS clients sometimes use beyond plain
    manifest/blob push+pull. Not required for the v0.1 push/pull round
    trip; a documented follow-up once a concrete ORAS consumer needs it.
  - **Manifest content validation** (schemaVersion, mediaType-specific
    layer/config referential integrity, garbage collection of
    unreferenced blobs). This handler stores and digest-validates
    opaque manifest bytes; it does not parse or interpret OCI manifest
    JSON structure."
