  "Real SHA-256 content digests for OCI manifests/blobs.

  KRP §16.2 (90-docs/adr/2607172200) is explicit that an OCI digest is
  Content identity (KRP §3.3) — a real CID-shaped hash, directly
  convertible to a CID (same hash function, different textual
  encoding) — UNLIKE the ETag/fingerprint carve-out in
  kotoba-lang/kotobase-protocols' hash.cljc, whose non-cryptographic
  FNV-1a fingerprints are explicitly documented as NOT CIDs. So this
  namespace does not reuse hash.cljc's fnv1a-32 fn; it reuses only its
  *pattern* (a small, dependency-free, reader-conditional digest that
  runs identically on the JVM compat suite and the first-class
  nbb/cljs runtime), computing a real SHA-256 instead.

  v0.1 hashes the UTF-8 bytes of a string body (kotobase.protocols.http
  treats :body as an opaque string; real binary blob bodies are the
  same documented follow-up carve-out http.cljc already declares, see
  kotobase.protocols.oci's namespace docstring)."
